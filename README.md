# ILF Modelling

Two approaches to fit a power law to premium vs sum insured data (including using GLMs) and plot the results.

We suppose a [power law relation][Wikipedia - Power Law] between the **Sum Insured** $x$ and the **Premium** $y$ of an insurance quote. This relation takes the form $$y(x) = \alpha x^{\beta}$$ which may alternatively be expressed as a linear relationship between $\log(x)$ and $\log(y)$ of the form $$\log(y) = \log(\alpha) + \beta \log(x),$$ where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are constants to be determined.

It follows that for any constant multiplying factor $c$ we have $y(cx) = c^{\beta} y(x)$, and in particular $y(2x) = 2^{\beta} y(x) = (1 + \gamma) y(x)$ for any sum insured $x$, where we call the constant $\gamma = 2^{\beta} - 1$ the **Increased Limit Factor**. This means that in our power law model, doubling the sum insured results in multiplying the premium by a factor of $1 + \gamma$, regardless of the reference sum insured value we doubled.

In the [demonstration notebook](https://github.com/edwardmpearce/ILF-modelling/blob/main/ILF-Demo.md) ([R Markdown source code](https://github.com/edwardmpearce/ILF-modelling/blob/main/ILF-Demo.Rmd), [Download rendered HTML notebook](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edwardmpearce/ILF-modelling/main/ILF-Demo.html)), we randomly generate a sample of quotes (pairs of sum insured and premium values), estimate the power law parameters using both a log-transformed linear regression model and a [Gamma distributed][Wikipedia - Gamma Distribution] [Generalized Linear Model][Wikipedia - Generalized Linear Model], then plot the results for comparison. We also discuss differences between the two approaches from the viewpoint of statistical theory.
